title: Mentu overview
description: An append-only commitment ledger where obligations require evidence. Designed for human+AI coordination.
---

import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Mentu is a commitment ledger — an append-only protocol where every obligation traces to a memory, and closure requires evidence. It is designed for human+AI interoperability: any agent or human can query Mentu to reconstruct the full state of a pipeline without local files.

## What you can do

**Track commitments as append-only records.** Every piece of work — a bug fix, a feature, a deployment — becomes a commitment with a full lifecycle: `commit → claim → evidence → submit → close`. Nothing is edited. Nothing is deleted.

**Attach evidence to every state transition.** Build passes, PR links, test results, circuit-breaker events — all captured as evidence arrays on the commitment. Closing a commitment requires proof, not just a status change.

**Coordinate agents and humans.** Mentu acts as the shared source of truth. Any participant (AI agent, CI pipeline, human developer) can query the ledger to understand what has been committed, what is in progress, and what has been delivered.

**Run autonomous pipelines.** The plugin's autopilot mode picks up committed work, runs triage and investigation, applies fixes, and pushes PRs — all while recording evidence at every step.

## The protocol

Mentu is built on three rules:

1. **Commitments trace to memories** — every obligation has an origin
2. **Closure requires evidence** — proving done, not marking done
3. **Append-only** — nothing edited, nothing deleted

These rules ensure that the ledger is a reliable, auditable record of all work. [Learn more about the protocol](/protocol/overview/).
